## Project Identity

Product Name: Nexus by MSI  
Tagline: Unified Business Core Platform

This project is transitioning from the existing Storbit Manifest application into Nexus by MSI, an end-to-end ERP Core Platform for MSI Group.

Nexus by MSI is designed to become the unified internal business platform for MSI Group, covering master data, transactions, workflows, approvals, operations, finance, reporting, audit trails, performance, security, and future API integrations across multiple entities.

---

## Business Entities

The platform must support multi-company and multi-entity operations from the beginning.

| Entity | Business Focus |
|---|---|
| MSI (PT Milenial Solusi Internusa) | Freight Forwarding |
| JCI (PT Jago Custom Indonesia) | PPJK / Customs Clearance |
| SOA (PT Stuja Orbit Abadi) | General Trading (formerly SBI/Storbit) |

Each entity may have different business processes, but the system must support connected group-level operations and consolidated reporting where permitted.

---

## Long-Term Product Direction

Nexus by MSI is intended to become an end-to-end ERP Core Platform covering:

- Foundation Core
- Organization & Access Control
- Master Data Management
- CRM & Customer Inquiry
- Quotation Management
- Sales Order / Surat Pesanan

- Customer / Vendor Portal
- Reporting & Dashboard
- Performance & Cache Layer
- Audit & Compliance

The first foundation module to prioritize is Master Data.

---

## Current Project Context

The project has transitioned from Storbit Manifest (localStorage prototype) into Nexus by MSI ERP.

**Stack (confirmed):**

- React 19 + Vite 8
- TailwindCSS 3
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS + Edge Functions)
- Vercel — auto-deploys from `main` → production at `storbitmanifest.dli.my.id`
- GitHub — `main` is the single integration + production branch

**Branch strategy (updated 2026-06-04):**

- `main` → production. Vercel deploys from `main`.
- Feature work committed directly to `main` (solo developer workflow).
- `fix/*` branches for hotfixes if needed, merged immediately to `main`.
- No long-lived feature branches. All phase-1 and phase-2 feature branches have been merged and deleted.

**Active modules (as of 2026-06-07):**

| Module | Status | Location |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Auth + RLS | ✅ Live | `src/contexts/`, `supabase/migrations/` |
| Master Data (Admin) | ✅ Live | `src/modules/admin/` |
| Products & Services | ✅ Live | `src/modules/admin/pages/ProductsPage.jsx` |
| Product Detail Modal | ✅ Live | `src/modules/admin/pages/ProductDetailPage.jsx` |
| Dashboard | ✅ Live | `src/modules/dashboard/` |
| App Launcher | ✅ Live | `src/modules/launcher/` |
| Asset Management | ✅ Live | `src/modules/assets/` |
| HRGA Request | ✅ Live | `src/modules/hrga/` |
| Logistics — Sales Order | ✅ Live | `src/modules/logistics/` |
| CRM — Pipeline, Inquiry, Quotation | ✅ Live | `src/modules/crm/` |
| CRM — Dashboard | ✅ Live (fully connected — KPI cards, Pipeline by Stage, Prospect Trend per week vs last month, Lead Source Distribution donut, Sales Performance table, Calendar Jadwal Visit — all from Supabase) | `src/modules/crm/CRMDashboardPage.jsx` |
| Inventory / Warehouse | ⚠️ Stok Barang live (fetches stock_summary + products + warehouses) | `src/modules/inventory/pages/StokBarangPage.jsx` |
| Inventory — Penerimaan Barang | ⚠️ Live (fetches products + warehouses + vendors; saves to stock_ledger) | `src/modules/inventory/pages/PenerimaanBarangPage.jsx` |

**Module structure (`src/modules/`):**

```
src/modules/
├── admin/        Master Data CRUD (Companies, Branches, Departments, Positions, Roles, Users, Products)
├── assets/       Asset Management (IT Equipment, Kendaraan, detail pages, useAssets hook)
├── crm/          CRM (Pipeline/Kanban, Inquiry, Quotation, Dashboard)
├── dashboard/    Command Center dashboard
├── hrga/         HRGA Request module (submit, approval, management)
├── launcher/     App Launcher (Odoo-style module grid)
└── logistics/    Sales Order list + SP Detail page
```

**Migration status (as of 2026-06-06):**

| Range | Scope | Staging | Production |
|-------|-------|---------|------------|
| 000–019 | Foundation, master data, RLS | ✅ Applied | ❌ Blocked |
| 020–024 | HRGA Request schema + seed | ✅ Applied | ❌ Blocked |
| 025–027 | Asset Management extensions | ✅ Applied | ❌ Blocked |
| 028 | New roles seed + role_permissions for all 13 roles | ⏳ Pending | ❌ Blocked |

Production execution is **BLOCKED** — requires explicit written approval from technical lead and product owner before any migration is applied to the production Supabase project.

**Important ongoing tech debt:**

- `src/App.jsx` is 3,900+ lines with 30+ inline components — needs decomposition.
- `PASTEL` design tokens duplicated in 22+ files — needs a single `src/lib/tokens.js`.
- `sp_items` has no `deleted_at` column — Delete SP currently hard-deletes.
- Legacy `can()` / `ROLES` hardcoded permission matrix in App.jsx — diverges from DB roles model.

Do not perform a big-bang rewrite.

---

## Core Engineering Principles

All work on this project must follow these principles:

1. Multi-company by design
2. Master data first
3. End-to-end business process mapping
4. Approval-driven workflow
5. Document numbering standard
6. Audit everything important
7. Soft delete by default
8. Granular role-permission
9. API-ready architecture
10. Finance impact ready
11. Reporting-ready data structure
12. Dev / staging / production separation
13. Modular frontend
14. Domain-based service and data layer
15. Server-side pagination and search
16. Performance-first data fetching
17. Safe caching strategy
18. Secure by default
19. Observable and monitorable
20. Smooth incremental migration from existing Storbit Manifest

---

## Non-Negotiable Safety Rules

Do not do any of the following unless explicitly instructed:

1. Do not rewrite the entire application.
2. Do not rewrite App.jsx in one large change.
3. Do not change database schema without explicit approval.
4. Do not change Supabase RLS policies without explicit approval.
5. Do not weaken RLS to make something work.
6. Do not expose secrets.
7. Do not expose Supabase service role keys in frontend code.
8. Do not install new dependencies without explicit approval.
9. Do not redesign the UI unless the task specifically asks for UI work.
10. Do not change production deployment settings without explicit approval.
11. Do not push or deploy unless explicitly instructed.
12. Do not remove existing working features unless explicitly instructed.
13. Do not hard-delete business data.
14. Do not bypass permission checks.
15. Do not create public API endpoints that return raw internal database rows.

---

## Required Reading Before Coding

Before writing or changing any code, you must have read and understood:

1. `CLAUDE.md` — this file (project identity, principles, safety rules)
2. `docs/architecture/nexus-master-blueprint.md` — product direction, tech stack, non-negotiable rules
3. `docs/security/security-baseline.md` — security rules, RLS requirements, MFA policy
4. `docs/performance/performance-baseline.md` — pagination, search, caching, indexing rules

Before working on a specific area, also read:

| Task Area | Additional Required Reading |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| Any new feature | `docs/architecture/feature-registry.md` |
| Database / schema work | `docs/database/core-schema-draft.md`, `docs/database/indexing-strategy.md` |
| Approval / document flow | `docs/workflow/approval-engine.md`, `docs/workflow/status-lifecycle.md` |
| Finance module | `docs/security/permission-matrix.md`, `docs/performance/reporting-performance.md` |
| Public API / integration | `docs/integration/api-strategy.md`, `docs/integration/public-tracking-api.md` |

| Caching implementation | `docs/performance/caching-strategy.md` |
| Audit logging | `docs/security/audit-log-policy.md` |

---

## Development Workflow

For every task, follow this workflow:

1. Inspect first
   - Check current branch.
   - Check git status.
   - Inspect relevant files.
   - Understand existing structure before editing.

2. Plan second
   - Explain intended changes.
   - Keep scope small and phase-based.
   - Avoid large multi-purpose changes.

3. Edit third
   - Modify only files required by the task.
   - Prefer incremental, low-risk changes.
   - Do not change unrelated code.

4. Verify fourth
   - Run available build/test/lint commands.
   - If a command is not available, state that clearly.
   - If a command fails, explain the exact failure and likely cause.

5. Summarize fifth
   - Summarize what changed.
   - List files changed.
   - Explain verification result.
   - Explain risk level.
   - Recommend the next step.

---

## Stricter Workflow Per Task Type

Different task types carry different risk levels. Follow the stricter workflow below on top of the general workflow above.

---

### Task Type: New Feature Development

Required reading: `docs/architecture/feature-registry.md`, `docs/security/security-baseline.md`, `docs/performance/performance-baseline.md`

Before coding:
- Confirm the feature is in the feature registry or add it first
- Confirm the target phase is current or approved
- Confirm no database schema change is needed (if yes, follow schema change workflow)
- Confirm no new dependencies are needed (if yes, get explicit approval)

During coding:
- Add server-side pagination to all new list views
- Add debounce to all new search inputs
- Select only required columns in all queries
- Add `deleted_at IS NULL` filter to all queries
- Add `company_id` filter to all queries
- Add audit log call for all create / update / delete actions
- Do not add hardcoded user IDs, company IDs, or role values
- Do not add `SELECT *` queries

After coding:
- Run `npm run build` — must pass
- Run `npm run lint` — must pass or explain pre-existing errors
- Manually verify the feature works end-to-end

---

### Task Type: Database Schema Change

> High risk. Requires explicit approval before execution.

Required reading: `docs/database/core-schema-draft.md`, `docs/database/entity-map.md`, `docs/database/indexing-strategy.md`

Before making any schema change:
1. State clearly: what table is being added or changed
2. State clearly: why this change is needed
3. State clearly: which existing data or queries are affected
4. Wait for explicit approval — do not proceed without it

When approved:
- Write migration SQL in `/supabase/migrations/{timestamp}_{description}.sql`
- Include rollback SQL as a comment or separate file
- Add `company_id` column with NOT NULL if it is a business table
- Add `deleted_at timestamptz` if it is a business table
- Add `created_by`, `updated_by` if it is a business table
- Add `created_at`, `updated_at` with `DEFAULT now()` if it is a business table
- Add minimum required indexes (see `docs/database/indexing-strategy.md`)
- Write RLS policy for new table immediately — never leave a table without RLS
- Test migration on development Supabase before staging

---

### Task Type: RLS Policy Change

> Critical risk. Requires explicit approval before execution.

Required reading: `docs/security/security-baseline.md`, `docs/database/core-schema-draft.md`

Rules:
- Never weaken RLS to make code work — fix the code instead
- Never disable RLS on a table that has business data
- All RLS policies must scope by `company_id`
- Test every RLS change with at least two different roles before applying to staging
- RLS changes must be documented in the PR description with before/after comparison
- Wait for explicit approval — do not proceed without it

---

### Task Type: UI / Frontend Change

Required reading: `docs/performance/performance-baseline.md`, `docs/performance/caching-strategy.md`

Rules:
- Do not redesign UI unless the task specifically asks for it
- Do not change unrelated UI components
- Do not add new npm packages without explicit approval
- All new list views must have server-side pagination
- All new search inputs must be debounced (min 300ms)
- All new large modules must use `React.lazy()` code splitting
- Do not compute aggregates or run heavy logic inside render functions
- Do not add `useEffect` that calls `setState` directly inside it unnecessarily
- Wrap new major page sections in `ErrorBoundary`

---

### Task Type: Refactor

Required reading: `docs/architecture/nexus-master-blueprint.md`

Rules:
- Refactor must not change any visible behavior
- Refactor must not change any data flow or business logic
- Scope must be small — one concern at a time (constants, utils, types)
- Run `npm run build` and `npm run lint` before and after — both must pass
- Do not rename database columns or table names as part of a frontend refactor
- Do not move files that are imported in many places without updating all imports

---

### Task Type: Documentation Update

Rules:
- Update the relevant `docs/` file when a feature, rule, or decision changes
- Update `docs/architecture/feature-registry.md` when a new feature is added
- Update `docs/architecture/implementation-roadmap.md` when phase status changes
- Update `CLAUDE.md` when a new standing rule or workflow is established
- Documentation changes do not require `npm run build` but should not break any imports

---

### Task Type: Hotfix (Production Emergency)

> Critical. Fast-track but still requires review.

Rules:
- Create `hotfix/{description}` branch from `main`
- Fix must be minimal — address only the critical issue
- Requires at least one reviewer even for fast-track
- Deploy to staging first, verify, then production
- Merge hotfix back to both `main` and `dev`
- Post-mortem required within 48 hours for any P1 issue

See `docs/operations/release-checklist.md` for full emergency process.

---

## Standard Output Format After Every Task

After completing any task, respond using this format:

Summary:
- ...

Files changed:
- ...

Verification:
- ...

Risk level:
- Low / Medium / High

What was intentionally not changed:
- ...

Next recommended step:
- ...

---

## Performance Requirements

Performance is a first-class requirement.

Rules:

1. Do not fetch all rows for large list pages.
2. Use server-side pagination for large tables.
3. Use server-side search, filter, and sort.
4. Use debounce for search inputs.
5. Avoid select * for large list queries.
6. Select only required columns where possible.
7. Use proper database indexes for frequent filters.
8. Use lazy loading / code splitting for large modules.
9. Use aggregate queries or materialized views for heavy dashboards.
10. Do not compute heavy reports entirely in frontend components.
11. Do not render thousands of table rows directly.
12. Use private storage and signed URLs for attachments.
13. Public API responses must be lightweight and masked.
14. Cache only where safe.
15. Never cache sensitive data carelessly.

Recommended important indexes for future transaction tables:

- company_id
- company_id + status
- company_id + created_at
- company_id + document_no
- customer_id
- vendor_id
- created_by
- deleted_at
- status

---

## Caching Strategy

Caching must be used carefully.

| Data Type | Caching Rule |
|---|---|
| Master data | Safe short-to-medium cache |
| Dashboard aggregate | Short cache |
| Transaction list | Short cache or refetch |
| Finance data | Very careful, avoid long cache |
| Audit log | Do not cache carelessly |
| Public tracking status | Short public-safe cache |
| Attachment signed URL | Short expiry |
| Permission/session data | Short cache, refetch on login/role change |

---

## Security Requirements

Security is mandatory.

Rules:

1. Use Supabase Auth.
2. MFA is required for admin, BOD, Finance Controller, and Head Level roles.
3. RLS must be company-scoped and role-aware.
4. Permission must be granular.
5. Do not rely only on frontend permission checks.
6. Audit all important actions.
7. Use soft delete by default for business data.
8. Important delete actions require approval.
9. Export must be restricted to Head Level and explicitly allowed roles.
10. Attachments must use private buckets and signed URLs.
11. Public APIs must use data masking and rate limiting.
12. API keys must be stored securely and must be rotatable.
13. Never expose service role keys in frontend code.
14. Never weaken RLS just to make code work.
15. Inactive users must be blocked or logged out.
16. Dev, staging, and production environments must be separated.
17. Error monitoring must be included in the strategy.
18. RLS must be reviewed before production changes.

Mandatory audit events:

- login
- logout
- create
- update
- delete
- soft_delete
- restore
- submit
- approve
- reject
- revise
- export
- import
- attachment_upload
- attachment_delete
- role_change
- permission_change
- api_request
- public_tracking_access

---

## Public API Rules

Nexus may later provide APIs for website tracking, customer portal, vendor portal, and integrations.

Public API must never expose internal raw rows.

Public API must not expose:

- vendor cost
- profit
- margin
- finance notes
- internal notes
- PIC internal
- customer credit limit
- audit logs
- private attachments
- internal approval history

Use DTOs for public response.

Example future public tracking flow:

Website
→ GET /api/public/tracking/{tracking_token}
→ Nexus API / Edge Function
→ validate token
→ fetch shipment public view
→ return masked DTO
→ log request

---

## Document Numbering Direction

Default document numbering format:

{DOC}/{ENTITY}/{DEPT}/{YYYY}/{SEQ}

Examples:

- QT/MSI/SLS/2026/0001
- SP/MSI/SLS/2026/0001
- SHP/MSI/LOG/2026/0001
- CUS/JCI/PPJK/2026/0001
- PR/MSI/IT/2026/0001
- PO/STB/PROC/2026/0001
- INV/JCI/FIN/2026/0001
- RMB/MSI/FIN/2026/0001
- AST/MSI/IT/2026/0001
- TCK/MSI/IT/2026/0001

---

## Approval Direction

Approval must be designed as a reusable engine, not hardcoded per module.

Approval should support:

- Company-based rules
- Department-based rules
- Document-type-based rules
- Amount-based rules
- Role-based rules
- Specific user approvers
- Backup approvers
- Delegation
- Revision after submit
- Comment history
- Approval history

Default status lifecycle:

- draft
- submitted
- under_review
- revision_requested
- revised
- approved
- rejected
- cancelled
- completed
- archived

---

| 2.3E | **Fix "klik modul tidak responsif setelah login user baru sampai refresh" + Fix D (permissionsLoading)**. Akar masalah (dari audit): `enterModule` punya stale closure (deps `[role]` saja → tak refresh saat permission load) + auth listener tak set `loading` saat login in-tab → App mount sebelum menuPermissions (query join berat) selesai → klik CRM no-op diam permanen sampai refresh. **FIX 1 — `App.jsx` `enterModule` (~1219):** deps jadi `[role, hasPermission, hasMenuPermission]` (closure refresh saat perms load); rewrite pakai `findFirstVisible(items)` rekursif (traverse children/grandchildren) karena grup CRM = 1 parent wrapper (`crm-dashboard`) yg membungkus semua page sbg children — `group.items.find` lama cuma cek wrapper (yg ada di MENU_KEY_MAP → gated) → `first` undefined saat perms kosong → early-return no-op. Sekarang cari leaf visible pertama; kalau parent visible tapi tak ada child visible, fallback ke parent. **FIX 2 — `AuthContext.jsx` listener `onAuthStateChange` (~106):** saat `event==='SIGNED_IN'` → `setLoading(true)` sebelum fetch profile, `setLoading(false)` di `.then` + `.catch` (mirror getSession path) → login in-tab tahan App sampai profile ready (sama spt refresh). **HANYA** untuk SIGNED_IN (TOKEN_REFRESHED/INITIAL_SESSION/USER_UPDATED tidak di-toggle → cegah flash loading screen tiap token auto-refresh). **FIX 3 (Fix D) — `permissionsLoading` flag:** state baru `permissionsLoading` init true; di-manage DI DALAM `fetchMenuPermissions` (async: `setPermissionsLoading(true)` di awal, `false` di `finally`) — bukan di body effect → tidak nambah set-state-in-effect lint; effect menuPermissions disederhanakan jadi `fetchMenuPermissions(session?.user?.id || null)` (hilangkan `else setMenuPermissions([])` sinkron, tapi tetap 1 error di line itu krn call sync setState di dalam fn). Expose `permissionsLoading` di context value. `App.jsx`: destructure `permissionsLoading`, pass ke AppLauncher sbg `permissionsLoading={permissionsLoading && !(role==='super_admin'||profile?.role==='super')}` (super tak pernah di-block). `AppLauncher.jsx`: prop `permissionsLoading`, import `Loader2`, subtitle jadi "Memuat izin akses…" + spinner saat loading, grid `aria-busy` + `opacity:0.55` + `pointerEvents:'none'` saat loading (klik di-block, tidak no-op diam), `@keyframes spin` ditambah. **Verifikasi mental:** login in-tab B → SIGNED_IN setLoading(true) spinner → profile ready loading false App mount → permissionsLoading true → launcher dim+blocked "Memuat izin akses…" → perms load setPermissionsLoading(false) + hasMenuPermission identity ganti → enterModule recreate (deps) → klik CRM traverse children → navigate TANPA refresh ✓; super_admin tak pernah ke-block ✓; refresh flow tetap ✓; token refresh tak flash ✓.

Sidebar di luar wrap → user tetap bisa navigasi saat Access Denied. **(4) Loading:** pakai RAW `permissionsLoading` di kondisi — saat true, ternary false → render konten normal (BUKAN Access Denied) → tidak ada false-deny saat permission belum load. super_admin tak pernah kena (canAccessActiveMenu true duluan). **Sinergi:** Fix B (2.3D) redirect restored activeMenu inaccessible → visibleMenus[0] setelah perms load; Fix D (2.3E) block klik launcher saat loading → praktis saat masuk modul perms sudah load.

| 2.6E | **Admin Settings — ApprovalWorkflowsPage + NotificationsPage (port desain Lovable, UI-only/dummy).** Bundle Claude Design `59YCY2WgHZcOx5eCywA5oQ`. 2 file baru di `src/pages/foundation/admin-settings/`, import komponen dari `./kit` + token dari `./tokens` (tidak redefine, kit.jsx/tokens.js TIDAK diubah). **ApprovalWorkflowsPage** (`{ onHome }`): EntitySwitcher + 2 tab — (A) Dokumen Bisnis: workflow cards (numbered approval steps + threshold + toggle aktif), filter pills per doc type, SlideOver editor (FloatingInput/Select, reorderable StepEditor, add/remove step), delete confirm inline, empty state; (B) HRGA Request: approver matrix per kategori (accordion, MiniSelect L1/L2/L3 per jenis request, SaveButton per kategori). **NotificationsPage** (`{ onHome }`): EntitySwitcher + 2 tab — (A) In-App: rules grouped (SP/Approval/CRM/HRGA), toggle + edit via Modal (channel cards, recipient pills, template subject/body, role select); (B) Email: layout sama tapi locked overlay "Coming Soon (SMTP)". Semua data dummy/statis (WF_SEED, HRGA_CATS, NOTIF_GROUPS), no Supabase. **Icon handling:** glyph yang TIDAK ada di registry `kit.jsx` Icon di-import langsung dari `lucide-react` (lib yg sama dipakai kit) — `User`, `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown` (ApprovalWorkflows: badge tipe approver + reorder step), `User`/`Users`/`ExternalLink` (Notifications: recipient badge, CRM group icon via `GroupIcon` helper, link SMTP); `clipboardlist` → pakai `clipboard` (kit alias = ClipboardList, sama). Step-editor Segmented opsi "User" pakai icon `building2` (kit Icon name-based, tak bisa terima komponen) — kompromi minor. Tiap page render `<KitStyles/>` (animasi ak-rise/ak-scroll). **Routing App.jsx:** lazy import 2 page; `AdminSettingsHub onOpen` mapping diperluas (`approval`→`admin-settings-approvals`, `notif`→`admin-settings-notifications`); 2 blok render baru (ErrorBoundary+Suspense, `onHome`→`setActiveMenu('admin-settings')`). Catch-all ComingSoon exclusion `startsWith('admin-settings')` + Fix B/Fix C whitelist `admin-settings-` (dari 2.6B) sudah cover sub-route baru → reachable utk admin. **AdminSettingsHub.jsx:** card `approval` + `notif` dipindah dari grup "Roadmap" ke "Konfigurasi Inti" dgn `status:'available'` (clickable, badge Tersedia); Roadmap tinggal 4 card. Sidebar/top bar/kit/tokens TIDAK disentuh. `npm run build` clean. Lint: sisa baseline set-state-in-effect + exhaustive-deps pada `useEffect(()=>{if(open)setForm(draft)},[open,draft&&draft.id])` (pola desain SlideOver/Modal), unused-var (`Card`, `_isNew`) sudah dibersihkan. **TODO lanjut:** sambung Supabase (approval_workflows + steps, hrga_approval matrix, notification_rules) — saat ini dummy. | ✅ Complete |

| 2.6E-verify | **NotificationsPage — re-sync vs bundle desain terbaru (Claude Design `aN-pS9TFzlLR8y0qshGWHA`)**. Diminta overwrite `NotificationsPage.jsx` dgn desain terbaru. Hasil diff: file bundle **identik secara fungsional** dgn yg sudah di-ship di 2.6E — TIDAK ada perubahan visual/struktur baru. Beda hanya adaptasi yg memang sengaja & wajib dipertahankan: (1) import dari `./kit`+`./tokens` + `export default` (bundle pakai global scope + `window.NotificationsPage`); (2) glyph yg tak ada di kit Icon registry di-import langsung dari `lucide-react` (`User`/`Users`/`ExternalLink`) + helper `GroupIcon` utk icon grup CRM 'users'; (3) `clipboardlist`→`clipboard` (kit alias = ClipboardList); (4) `<KitStyles/>` di-render; (5) cleanup lint `_isNew` (delete pattern) + dep `[value, minH]`. Revert ke bentuk bundle = regresi + build break (global NAVY/Icon bukan import). Kesimpulan: file sudah faithful port dari desain ini → tidak ada churn (overwrite = no-op fungsional). Routing/koneksi (App.jsx admin-settings-notifications, AdminSettingsHub card) tidak disentuh. File lain tidak diubah. `npm run build` clean. | ✅ Complete |

Kedua page: refetch saat ganti entitas (effect dep `[entity, reload]`); page-shell fake-timer lama diganti fetch-state (Approval shell tetap pakai timer + per-tab fetch — mirror 2.6C; Notifications shell full fetch-state). **Catatan mapping:** approval step `approver_user_id` (uuid) di-isi dari text field UI "Cari User" apa adanya — kalau user ketik non-uuid & simpan step type=user → INSERT error (graceful toast), realistis pakai type=role; user-picker asli = future. HRGA row `active` toggle disimpan ke configs `is_active` saat Simpan Semua; fetch filter is_active=true → toggle-off tidak round-trip terlihat (limitation kecil, sesuai spek fetch). **Prasyarat DB (staging):** tabel `approval_workflows`, `approval_workflow_steps` (FK workflow_id ON DELETE CASCADE), `notification_rules`; `hrga_request_types`+`hrga_approval_configs` sudah ada (migration 020).

| 2.7A | **Pindah Asset Management dari grup "Inventory & Asset" ke grup "Service Management" (App.jsx, menu only).** (1) Grup `Inventory & Asset` → rename label jadi **`Inventory`** (+ comment header); section `Asset Management` + item `assets` (beserta semua children `assets-*`) DIHAPUS dari grup ini → grup Inventory kini hanya berisi Inventory / Warehouse. (2) Grup `Service Management`: tambah `{ section: 'Asset Management' }` + item `assets` PERSIS SAMA (id `assets` + 17 children `assets-*` identik) SETELAH item `it` (IT Service Mgmt). (3) `MENU_KEY_MAP`: `'assets': 'inv_asset'` → `'assets': 'service_asset'`. (4) Semua id `assets-*` TIDAK berubah; routing/logic assets (AssetShell render block, `navigateToAssetDetail`, group-lookup di ~L1220 yg cari grup berisi `assets` secara dinamis) TIDAK disentuh → auto-adapt ke grup Service Management. (5) Cek `inv_asset`: hanya 1 ref (MENU_KEY_MAP) → 0 tersisa. **App Launcher (point 4):** AppLauncher pakai `moduleGroups = ERP_MENU_GROUPS`, jadi rename label 'Inventory' + Asset Management masuk children Service Management OTOMATIS ter-refleksi (label grup & drill-in dari ERP_MENU_GROUPS). **⚠️ Side effect (TIDAK di-fix — `AppLauncher.jsx` di luar scope "hanya App.jsx"):** `AppLauncher.jsx` punya 3 map yg di-key by label literal `'Inventory & Asset'` — `MODULE_CFG` (icon Package/warna #D97706/desc), `LAUNCHER_MODULE_MAP` ('inventory' utk gating), `GRID_POS` (col2/row2). Karena label grup kini 'Inventory', ketiga lookup miss → card launcher "Inventory" fallback ke default (icon Database, warna abu #6B7280, tanpa grid-pos tetap, gating fallback). Bukan crash (spread `{...undefined}` no-op). **Follow-up disarankan (1 file, 3 key):** di `AppLauncher.jsx` rename key `'Inventory & Asset'`→`'Inventory'` di MODULE_CFG + LAUNCHER_MODULE_MAP + GRID_POS. Service Management card tidak berubah (label sama). build clean. Tidak ada file lain diubah. | ✅ Complete |

Setelah grup ERP_MENU_GROUPS di-rename ke 'Inventory' (2.7A), ketiga lookup `group.label` cocok lagi → card launcher "Inventory" balik pakai icon/warna/grid-pos/gating yg benar (bukan fallback abu Database). Hanya key string yg diubah (3 occurrence, value/whitespace lain tidak disentuh). 0 ref `'Inventory & Asset'` tersisa. build clean. Tidak ada file lain diubah. | ✅ Complete |

Helper format `fmtShortRp` (M/Jt) + `fmtBigRp` (Miliar/Juta) lokal (tak ada shared util di module). **Komponen UI dipertahankan:** Card/CardHead/StatCard/CoBadge/Badge/Btn; `DonutChart`+`CompanyValueChart` di-parameterize (terima props, bukan const internal). **Loading** → `DashboardSkeleton` (grey block sesuai tema warm); **Error** → card + tombol "Coba Lagi" (retry `load()`). **Empty state "Fitur segera hadir":** Timeline Expiry Dokumen + tabel Dokumen Akan Expired (krn `asset_documents` belum ada) — `ExpiryBarsChart`/`EXPIRY_ROWS`/`URGENCY_LABEL` dummy dihapus.

## Asset Management — Deep Audit (15 Jun 2026, audit-only, 0 file diubah)

Audit modul `src/modules/assets/` + hook `src/hooks/useAssets.js` vs DB.

### FILES AUDIT
| File | Status | Tabel / sumber |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `hooks/useAssets.js` | ✅ Supabase | `assets` (+join `companies`,`asset_locations`,`asset_categories`), `asset_categories`, `asset_specifications`, `asset_network`, `asset_software_licenses`, `asset_maintenance_records`, `asset_fuel_logs`. 4 hook: useITAssets (list paginated), useAssetDetail, useFuelLogs, useITAssetDetail. Query rapi (deleted_at IS NULL, no SELECT *, graceful 42P01). |
| `AssetShell.jsx` | ✅ Router | Routing only; non-implemented page → `<ComingSoon>` stub. |
| `AssetITPage.jsx` | ✅ Supabase | `useITAssets({ categoryCode })` — dipakai utk **IT-EQP / VEH / FURN / BLDG** (4 list page generik). Real data, server pagination, filter, search debounce. |
| `AssetDetailPage.jsx` | ⚠️ Partial | `useAssetDetail`+`useFuelLogs`. Tab **Info Dasar** & **BBM** = real. Tab **Dokumen/Maintenance/Rute/History** = placeholder ("akan tampil setelah modul … diimplementasi"). IT-EQP didelegasikan ke AssetDetailITPage. Tab spec/network/software di file ini = dead-code placeholder (tak terjangkau krn IT delegate). |
| `AssetDetailITPage.jsx` | ✅ Supabase | `useITAssetDetail` — specs/network/software/maintenance semua real; Health Score dihitung client-side dari data real. |
| `AssetDashboardPage.jsx` | ✅ Supabase (Phase 2.7B) | `assets` + `asset_categories` (aggregate client-side). Dulu 100% dummy → sekarang real. |

### TABEL MISSING (dibutuhkan UI, BELUM ada di DB)
1. **`asset_documents`** (+ expiry) — KRITIS. Dipakai: tab Dokumen (STNK/BPKB/KIR/Asuransi di AssetDetailPage), sidebar `assets-docs`/`assets-expiring`/`assets-expired`, dashboard expiry chart + tabel. Semua placeholder/dummy krn tak ada tabel.
2. **`asset_work_orders`** — sidebar `assets-workorders` + dashboard "6 work order aktif" (badge dummy).
3. **`asset_routes`/`asset_trips`** — tab Rute kendaraan (placeholder).
   (Vendor & Supplier: tabel global `vendors` SUDAH ADA (migration 009) tapi belum ada page/link aset; `asset_categories` & `asset_locations` SUDAH ADA tapi belum ada management page.)

### FIELD MISMATCHES
**TIDAK ADA.** Semua kolom yg di-query terverifikasi ada di DB: `assets` (012 base + 025 IT cols: asset_code/serial_number/model/asset_subtype/assigned_to_name/vendor_name/purchase_invoice_no + 026 vehicle cols: plate_number/color/manufacture_year/fuel_type/vin/engine_number/km_odometer), serta kolom eksplisit di software_licenses/maintenance_records/fuel_logs/specifications/network semua cocok. Hook pakai graceful 42P01 → tabel absen tidak crash.

### DUMMY DATA INVENTORY (semua di `AssetDashboardPage.jsx`)
- StatCards baris 1: Total Kendaraan `64`, IT `128`, Furniture `212`, Properti `18` (hardcoded).
- StatCards baris 2: Total Aktif `384`, Dalam Maintenance `21`, Dokumen Expired `4`, Disposed `13`.
- `DonutChart` — legend Furniture/IT/Kendaraan/Properti + center `422`.
- Total Nilai `Rp 42,82 Miliar` + breakdown per kelas; `CompanyValueChart` bars (msi/jci/sbi).
- `ExpiryBarsChart` — `months` array hardcoded.
- `EXPIRY_ROWS` — 7 baris dokumen expiry hardcoded; `URGENCY_LABEL`.
- Header "Per 2 Juni 2026, 09:14 WIB" statis.
- **Plus badge sidebar hardcoded di App.jsx ERP_MENU_GROUPS:** `assets-it` badge `128`, `assets-workorders` `6`, `assets-expiring` `9`, `assets-expired` `4`.
- Placeholder (bukan dummy data, tapi tab belum tersambung) di AssetDetailPage: Dokumen, Rute, History (parsial), **Maintenance** (catatan: tabel `asset_maintenance_records` SUDAH ADA & sudah dipakai AssetDetailITPage — tab Maintenance kendaraan tinggal di-wire, low-hanging fruit).

### MISSING PAGES (sidebar → ComingSoon stub di AssetShell)
11 item belum ada implementasi (render `<ComingSoon>` "sedang dalam pengembangan"): `assets-analytics`, `assets-maint` (Jadwal Maintenance), `assets-hist` (History Maintenance), `assets-workorders`, `assets-docs`, `assets-expiring`, `assets-expired`, `assets-kategori`, `assets-lokasi`, `assets-vendor`, `assets-settings`.
Sudah ada page: `assets` (Dashboard — dummy), `assets-it`/`-kendaraan`/`-furniture`/`-properti` (AssetITPage — real), `assets-detail` (AssetDetailPage/AssetDetailITPage — real/partial).

### REKOMENDASI PRIORITAS
1. **Wire AssetDashboardPage ke Supabase** (aggregate dari `assets`: count per kategori, per status, total book_value, per company) — ganti semua dummy. Badge sidebar idealnya dinamis (tapi itu App.jsx).
2. **Wire tab Maintenance kendaraan** di AssetDetailPage ke `asset_maintenance_records` (tabel sudah ada, pola sudah dipakai di AssetDetailITPage).
3. **Buat `asset_documents`** (+ expiry) → aktifkan tab Dokumen, page Semua/Akan/Sudah Expired, dashboard expiry. (perlu approval skema)
4. Page management `assets-kategori` & `assets-lokasi` (tabel sudah ada), `assets-vendor` (pakai `vendors`).
5. `asset_work_orders` + page Work Orders; `asset_routes` + tab Rute (perlu approval skema).

Next recommended step: **(1) Runtime-verify SELURUH migrasi accounts di staging: Pipeline/Prospect/Dashboard/Inquiry/Calls/Quotation/Master Customer (per-entitas + Free Agent) + Customer Detail (BANT dari row account, visit by id, Health Score). Kalau DBA rename constraint ke `accounts_*`, SEMUA embed `prospects_*`/`*_prospect_id_fkey`/`prospects_owner_company_id_fkey` error → update `!constraint`. Test: drag WON → account_status='customer' & muncul di Master Customer; tambah customer → account_status='customer'+owner_company_id. (2) ✅ Tabel `customers`→`accounts` SELESAI di kode (Phase 2.5A) — runtime-verify staging: SP list nama customer dari accounts, create customer dari Storbit (account_status=customer + owner_company_id), inquiry sumber Customer tersimpan di prospect_id; kalau constraint di-rename pasca-repoint, update embed `!constraint` (sp_items/ar_ttfs/inquiries/quotations_customer_id_fkey). Tabel `customers` lama tinggal di-drop setelah verifikasi (perlu approval). (3) Cleanup: status-filter dropdown CustomerListPage (active/inactive degenerate). Pending lain: verify 2.1F/2.1G UI, staging `sales_calls`/quotation cols.**

## Debugging Field Notes

Lessons learned from real debugging sessions on this project. Read before diagnosing RLS or staging issues.

### RLS Policy Not Applied to Staging (2026-06-02)

**Symptom:**
Super admin user (Den Bagus) could only see MSI branches. JCI branches were not visible despite the UI correctly showing the "SUPER ADMIN" role label.

**Root cause:**
Migration 019 (`20260524000019_org_master_super_admin_read_bypass.sql`) was not applied to staging. The active `branches_read` policy was still the migration 014 shape:

```sql
-- Migration 014 — WRONG for super admin cross-company reads
(company_id = get_user_company_id()) AND ((deleted_at IS NULL) OR is_super_admin())
```

`is_super_admin()` is nested inside the `company_id` condition. It only bypasses `deleted_at` — the company scope filter is never bypassed regardless of role.

The correct shape (migration 019):

```sql
-- Migration 019 — CORRECT
is_super_admin() OR (company_id = get_user_company_id() AND deleted_at IS NULL)
```

`is_super_admin()` is a top-level OR — when true, the entire company scope filter is bypassed.

**Fix applied:**
Manually ran migration 019 SQL in Supabase SQL Editor on staging.

**Key lesson — always verify active policy before debugging frontend:**

```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'branches' AND cmd = 'SELECT';
```

Check `qual` — confirm `is_super_admin()` is the outermost condition, not nested inside `company_id`.

---

### RLS Debugging Protocol

Follow this order before assuming a frontend bug when data is missing or filtered unexpectedly:

1. **Check `pg_policies`** — confirm the active policy shape matches the expected migration.
   Use: `SELECT policyname, cmd, qual FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = '<table>' AND cmd = 'SELECT';`

2. **Test `is_super_admin()` from the browser session** — add a temporary `console.debug` in the relevant page component (not Dashboard — it is purely presentational and does not import supabase):

   ```js
   // Temporary — remove after debug
   useEffect(() => {
     supabase.auth.getSession().then(({ data: { session } }) => {
       console.debug('[debug] uid =', session?.user?.id);
     });
     supabase.rpc('is_super_admin').then(({ data }) => {
       console.debug('[debug] is_super_admin =', data);
     });
     supabase.rpc('get_user_company_id').then(({ data }) => {
       console.debug('[debug] get_user_company_id =', data);
     });
   }, []);
   ```

3. **Do not test RLS in the SQL Editor as a substitute for browser session testing.**
   `auth.uid()` always returns NULL in the SQL Editor — it runs as service role, not as the authenticated user. `is_super_admin()` and `get_user_company_id()` will always return false/null in that context.

4. **Do not test RPC from DevTools console directly.**
   The Supabase client is not exposed on the `window` object. Temporary `console.debug` calls inside the page component are the correct approach.

5. **Never assume a migration was applied** — always verify with `pg_policies` or `information_schema`. Migrations applied to one environment (dev/staging/production) are independent. A migration committed to the repo is not automatically applied anywhere.

### HRGA Request Module — Lessons Learned (2026-06-02)

Lessons from building the first Service Management module. Apply to all future modules.

---

#### 1. Tables created via Supabase CLI do NOT get auto-grants

**Symptom:** `permission denied for table <table>` even for super admin.

**Root cause:** Tables created via `supabase db push` (CLI) do not automatically receive
`SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` grants for the `authenticated` role — unlike tables created via
the Supabase Dashboard. PostgreSQL checks table-level privilege **before** evaluating RLS.
The result: every operation is denied before RLS is even reached.

**Fix:** Every migration that creates tables via CLI must include explicit GRANTs:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON <table> TO authenticated;
```

Add this immediately after `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, before the policy definitions.
Use INSERT-only for immutable audit tables (e.g. `hrga_request_approvals`).

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT table_name, string_agg(privilege_type, ', ' ORDER BY privilege_type) AS granted
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants
WHERE table_name = '<table>' AND grantee = 'authenticated'
  AND privilege_type IN ('SELECT','INSERT','UPDATE','DELETE')
GROUP BY table_name;
```

---

#### 2. hrga_approval_configs must always be filtered by company_id

**Symptom:** `Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object` on submit.

**Root cause:** `hrga_approval_configs` is seeded once per company — the same `request_type_id`
has N rows (one per company). Querying with only `request_type_id + level` returns multiple rows;
`.single()` throws the coerce error.

**Rule:** Always include `.eq('company_id', profile.company_id)` on every
`hrga_approval_configs` query. Never filter by `request_type_id` alone.

```js
// WRONG — returns N rows across companies
supabase.from('hrga_approval_configs')
  .eq('request_type_id', id).eq('level', 1).single()

// CORRECT
supabase.from('hrga_approval_configs')
  .eq('company_id', profile.company_id)
  .eq('request_type_id', id).eq('level', 1).single()
```

Same applies to `hrga_request_types` in any query that expects a single row per type_code —
always scope by `company_id`.

---

#### 3. increment_document_sequence RPC must be created explicitly

**Symptom:** 404 on RPC call; fallback read-then-update hits 406 (no row) or 403 (RLS).

**Root cause:** The RPC `increment_document_sequence` was referenced in app code but never
defined in any migration. `document_sequences` INSERT was also restricted to `is_admin_or_above()`,
blocking non-admin staff from initialising a new sequence row.

**Fix (migration 023):**
1. Create `increment_document_sequence(company_id, document_type, department_code, year, month)`
   as `SECURITY DEFINER` — atomically increments, inserts row if missing, returns new integer.
2. Grant `EXECUTE` to `authenticated`.
3. Relax `document_sequences_insert` RLS from `is_admin_or_above()` to `company_id = get_user_company_id()`.
4. Seed initial rows for new document types before they are used.

**Template for any new document type:**
```sql
-- Seed sequence rows for a new document type across all active companies
INSERT INTO document_sequences (company_id, document_type, department_code, year, month, last_sequence)
SELECT id, '<CODE>', '<DEPT>', EXTRACT(YEAR FROM now())::int, 0, 0
FROM companies WHERE is_active = true
ON CONFLICT (company_id, document_type, department_code, year, month) DO NOTHING;
```

---

#### 4. useHrgaRequestTypes must be called with companyId

**Symptom:** Type picker shows every request type 3×.

**Root cause:** The hook `useHrgaRequestTypes()` fetched all rows without a `company_id` filter.
Types are seeded per company (20 types × 3 companies = 60 rows total).

**Fix:** Hook signature changed to `useHrgaRequestTypes(companyId)`. Always pass
`profile.company_id` from `useAuth()`. The hook skips the query if `companyId` is falsy.

```js
// WRONG
const { data: types } = useHrgaRequestTypes();

// CORRECT
const { profile } = useAuth();
const { data: types } = useHrgaRequestTypes(profile?.company_id);
```

---

#### 5. Supabase default query limit is 10 rows

**Symptom:** List page shows only 10 items even though the database has more (e.g. ProductsPage showed 10 MSI products, missing 5 JCI + 63 SOA).

**Root cause:** Supabase's PostgREST default page size is 10 rows. If no `.limit()` is set, the client silently returns the first 10 rows only — no error, no warning.

**Fix:** Always add `.limit(1000)` (or implement proper server-side pagination with `.range()`) on any list query.

```js
// WRONG — silently returns only 10 rows
supabase.from('products').select('*').is('deleted_at', null)

// CORRECT — explicit limit for small-medium catalogs
supabase.from('products').select('*').is('deleted_at', null).limit(1000)

// CORRECT — server-side pagination for large tables
supabase.from('products').select('*', { count: 'exact' }).range(from, to)
```

**Rule:** Every `.from().select()` query that doesn't use `.range()` pagination MUST have `.limit(N)` where N is comfortably above the expected maximum row count. For catalog/master data tables, `.limit(1000)` is the safe default.

---

#### 6. Products RLS — super_admin sees all companies

**Symptom:** ProductsPage company tabs showed 0 for JCI and SOA even after fixing the limit.

**Root cause:** Two issues combined:
1. PostgREST join (`companies(code, name)`) can return null if the FK relationship isn't auto-detected, causing all rows to map to the default company (`'MSI'`).
2. RLS policy on `products` table may scope by `company_id = get_user_company_id()`, blocking super_admin from seeing other companies' products.

**Fix applied:**
- Fetched `companies` table separately to build a reliable `{ uuid → code }` map.
- Used `product.company_id` with the map for lookup instead of relying on join.
- Verified super_admin RLS policy on `products` allows cross-company reads (`is_super_admin() OR company_id = get_user_company_id()`).

**Rule:** Never rely on PostgREST join (`table(col)`) for critical field mapping. For company code resolution, always fetch the companies table separately and build a UUID→code map.

---

#### 7. RLS INSERT policy must match the actual status at insert time

**Symptom:** 403 on `hrga_request_items` insert immediately after header insert.

**Root cause:** The INSERT policy checked `r.status = 'draft'`. The submit flow creates the
header with `status = 'submitted'` directly (no draft step in UI), then inserts items.
By the time items are inserted, the parent is already `submitted` → EXISTS returns false.

**Fix:** Expand INSERT policy to `status IN ('draft', 'submitted')`.

**Rule:** Before writing an RLS INSERT policy that checks a related row's status, trace the
exact sequence of operations in the application code. The policy must match the status value
that will be present *at the moment the INSERT occurs*, not the final desired status.

---

## Final Reminder

This project must be evolved carefully.

Do not build all ERP modules at once.

Plan end-to-end, but build foundation first.

Always prioritize:

- Security
- Performance
- Auditability
- Scalability
- Maintainability

## CRM Module — Schema Notes (updated 2026-06-05)

### Tabel: prospects → RENAMED jadi `accounts` (Phase 2.2A, Batch 1)
- ⚠️ Tabel `prospects` sudah di-rename jadi **`accounts`**. Query CRM Batch 1 (Pipeline/Prospect/Dashboard) sudah pakai `.from('accounts')` + `.eq('account_status', 'prospect')`.
- **Sudah dimigrasi (prospects→accounts SELESAI semua):** Batch 1 (Pipeline/Prospect/Dashboard/useCustomFields/SchemaManager — 2.2A); Batch 2 (Inquiry/Calls/Quotation embeds — 2.2B & 2.2B-fix); Batch 3 (CustomerListPage/CustomerDetailPage → accounts WHERE account_status='customer' — 2.2C). **Repo: 0 ref tabel `prospects`.**
- **✅ SELESAI (Phase 2.5A) — tabel `customers` → `accounts`:** migrasi DB selesai (5 FK sp_items/ar_ttfs/inquiries/quotations/accounts.converted_to sudah repoint ke `accounts`; INDOMARCO pindah, id sama). Kode sudah ikut: **db.js** (Storbit SP/AR — listCustomers/upsertCustomer/deleteCustomer + embed SP/AR pakai alias `customers:accounts!<constraint>(name)`) + **CRM** (InquiryFormPage dropdown → accounts WHERE account_status='customer', simpan ke prospect_id; embed InquiryListPage/QuotationListPage/QuotationDetailPage/QuotationFormPage `customer:accounts!*_customer_id_fkey`). **Repo: 0 ref tabel `customers` di file live.** Tabel `customers` lama MASIH ADA (dipensiunkan, jangan dihapus). CustomerMasterPage.legacy.jsx & UserManagement.legacy.jsx = dead, abaikan.
- `account_status`: 'prospect' / 'customer' / 'lost' / 'free_agent'. Pipeline = `account_status='prospect'`; Master Customer = `account_status='customer'`.
- Kolom accounts: + `owner_company_id`, `tier`, `code`, `nomor_kontrak`, `default_dc`, `last_activity_at`, `became_customer_at`.
- **FK constraint TIDAK ikut berubah** saat rename tabel → embed tetap pakai nama constraint lama `prospects_assigned_to_fkey`, `inquiries_prospect_id_fkey`, dll (hanya nama tabel target yang `prospects`→`accounts`). Kalau DBA me-rename constraint, update bagian `!constraint` di embed.
- WON di pipeline → auto set `account_status='customer'` + `became_customer_at`.
- Gunakan kolom `name` bukan `company_name`
- Gunakan kolom `payment_terms_id` bukan `payment_term_id`
- Tidak ada kolom `company_name` — jangan pakai ini di query manapun

### Tabel: inquiries
- Kolom `deleted_at` sudah ada (ditambah via ALTER TABLE 2026-06-05)

### Tabel: quotations
- Kolom tambahan: `usd_rate numeric(15,2)` — kurs USD ke IDR, input manual per quotation
- `route text` — routing info e.g. "CHICAGO > SEMARANG", sudah ada di tabel

### Tabel: quotation_items
- Kolom lengkap: id, quotation_id, sort_order, description, qty, unit, unit_price, notes, group_name, currency, unit_label, exchange_rate, total
- Tidak ada kolom `total` yang GENERATED — total dihitung di frontend dan disimpan manual

### RLS & Permissions — PENTING
- Tabel CRM (prospects, inquiries, quotations, quotation_items) menggunakan GRANT ALL ke role authenticated
- RLS di-disable untuk keempat tabel ini untuk MVP
- Jangan tambahkan RLS policy berbasis get_user_company_id() untuk tabel CRM — akan menyebabkan permission denied
- Tabel baru yang dibuat via SQL Editor harus di-GRANT manual: `GRANT ALL ON TABLE nama_tabel TO anon, authenticated, service_role;`

### quotation_items — tambahan kolom (2026-06-05)
- `cost_price numeric(15,2)` — harga cost internal, tidak boleh muncul di print/PDF
- Gunakan CSS class `no-print` untuk semua elemen cost dan profit summary
- Total IDR di-hitung dari `unit_price × qty` (× kurs kalau USD) — bukan dari cost_price
- Gross profit = subtotal − total_cost, hanya tampil di sidebar internal (no-print)

### Print/PDF
- Gunakan class `no-print` untuk elemen yang tidak boleh muncul di PDF (cost price, margin, action buttons, sidebar, topbar)
- Gunakan class `print-only` untuk elemen yang hanya muncul saat print (logo, header quotation)
- PDF di-trigger via window.print() atau tombol Download PDF di QuotationDetailPage
- CSS print diinjeksi via `<style>` tag di dalam komponen (tidak perlu global CSS)

### PDF Generation
- Library: jspdf + html2canvas (sudah di-install, approval eksplisit 2026-06-05)
- Trigger: tombol "Download PDF" di QuotationDetailPage
- Print area: div#quotation-print-area — TIDAK boleh mengandung cost_price atau margin
- Customer details table: 2 kolom, label cell background #1a3a2a text putih, value cell background #f9f9f7
- Urutan konten print area: header logo → customer details table → notes → sections → summary → terms → Best Regards → footer
- creatorProfile di-fetch dari profiles JOIN positions, dipakai untuk nama & jabatan di Best Regards
- Field `terms` di tabel quotations: diisi sales di QuotationFormPage, muncul sebagai "• Above rates" di PDF
- Print area di-posisikan off-screen (`position: absolute; left: -9999px`) agar invisible di screen tapi tetap ada di DOM saat html2canvas dipanggil
- File output: {quotation_no}_rev{revision}.pdf
- jsPDF handle multi-page otomatis via loop heightLeft

### BTB Numbers — sp_btbs table
- Tabel: `sp_btbs` — id, sp_no, btb_no, created_at
- BTB No sekarang di SP-level, bukan item-level
- `btb_no` di `sp_items` sudah di-rename jadi `btb_no_deprecated` — jangan pakai lagi
- db.js functions: `listSpBtbs(spNo)`, `addSpBtb(spNo, btbNo)`, `deleteSpBtb(id)`, `bulkInsertSpBtbs(spNo, btbNos[])`
- UI: BTB Numbers section di SalesOrderDetailPage Overview tab + InputSPPage form card

### Dynamic Custom Fields
- Hook: `src/hooks/useCustomFields.js` — fetch via `get_table_columns` RPC, filter STANDARD_COLUMNS
- Component: `src/components/CustomFieldsSection.jsx` — renders inputs per data_type, supports readOnly mode
- STANDARD_COLUMNS exported dari hook — list kolom bawaan per tabel, kolom di luar list = custom field
- Custom fields di-save langsung ke kolom di tabel yang bersangkutan (tidak ada tabel terpisah)
- CustomerModal: customValues state, populate dari initial pada edit mode, merged ke save payload

### Schema Manager
- File: `src/modules/admin/pages/SchemaManagerPage.jsx`
- Hanya untuk role `'super'` atau `'super_admin'` — dual check karena legacy `'super'` masih di DB
- Memanggil Edge Function `manage-schema` dengan action `add_column`
- Fetch kolom existing via RPC `get_table_columns` (fallback dari information_schema view)
- Menu ID: `schema-manager` di Foundation > Master Data

### Mismatch yang sudah pernah terjadi — jangan ulangi
- prospects.company_name → SALAH, pakai `name`
- prospects.payment_term_id → SALAH, pakai `payment_terms_id`
- quotation_items.total GENERATED → SALAH, kolom ini sudah di-DROP dan diganti plain numeric
- inquiries.deleted_at → sudah ada, boleh dipakai
- profiles.is_active → SALAH, kolom namanya `active` (bukan `is_active`) — pakai `.eq('active', true)` saat query profiles
- Business process correctness

### ProspectFormPage — SOURCE options (updated 2026-06-12)
11 options (value): sales_visit, cold_call, referral, existing_network, exhibition, instagram, linkedin, tiktok, website, walk_in, other. Default `source: 'sales_visit'`.
Labels: Sales Visit, Cold Call, Referral, Existing Network, Exhibition / Pameran, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, Website, Walk-in, Lainnya.
**Sync:** `SOURCE_LABELS_KP` di PipelineKanbanPage.jsx harus pakai value yang sama (label boleh beda — KP pakai 'Exhibition' tanpa '/ Pameran'). Removed dari versi lama: digital_marketing, event, social_media (jangan dipakai lagi).
**`sourceToSvc` (PipelineKanbanPage.jsx) — badge grouping per source (cover 11 value):** sales_visit/cold_call/referral/existing_network/walk_in/other → `'forwarding'`; exhibition → `'trading'`; instagram/linkedin/tiktok/website → `'digital'`. Fallback `'forwarding'`. Map `SVC` (warna badge) punya semua key: `forwarding` (label 'Forwarding', bg #EEF2FF, fg #144682), `trading` (label 'Trading', bg #FEF3EE, fg #E85A1E), `digital`, plus 5 lama (sea/air/land/customs/wh/project). Catatan: entri SVC pakai key `fg` untuk warna teks (bukan `color`) — konsumen baca `svc.fg` di DealCard & ListRow.
Assigned To: fetch dari `profiles` dengan filter `active = true` + `company_id` + `.limit(1000)`. Tidak filter by role — semua user aktif bisa di-assign.
